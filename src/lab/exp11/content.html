		    <p>						In fluid dynamics, a vortex (plural vortices/vortexes)[1][2] is a region in a fluid in which the flow revolves around an axis line, which may be straight or curved.[3][4] Vortices form in stirred fluids, and may be observed in smoke rings, whirlpools in the wake of boat, or the winds surrounding a tornado or dust devil.

Vortices are a major component of turbulent flow. The distribution of velocity, vorticity (the curl of the flow velocity), as well as the concept of circulation are used to characterize vortices. In most vortices, the fluid flow velocity is greatest next to its axis and decreases in inverse proportion to the distance from the axis.

In the absence of external forces, viscous friction within the fluid tends to organize the flow into a collection of irrotational vortices, possibly superimposed to larger-scale flows, including larger-scale vortices. Once formed, vortices can move, stretch, twist, and interact in complex ways. A moving vortex carries with it some angular and linear momentum, energy, and mass.</p>

          <strong>EQUIPMENTS:</strong><br> 
The flow of real fluids can basically occur under two very different regimes namely laminar and turbulent flow. The laminar flow is characterized by fluid particles moving in the form of lamina sliding over each other, such that at any instant the velocity at all the points in particular lamina is the same. The lamina near the flow boundary move at a slower rate as compared to those near the center of the flow passage. This type of flow occurs in viscous fluids, fluids moving at slow velocity and fluids flowing through narrow passages. 

          </p>
          <p align="justify">
          The turbulent flow is characterized by constant agitation and intermixing of fluid particles such that their velocity changes from point to point and even at the same point from time to time. This type of flow occurs in low density 
Fluids flow through wide passage and in high velocity flows.<br> 
Reynolds conducted an experiment for observation and determination of these regimes of flow. By introducing a fine filament of dye in to the flow of water through the glass tube, at its entrance he studied the different types of flow. At low velocities the dye filament appeared as straight line through the length of the tube and parallel to its axis, characterizing laminar flow. As the velocity is increased the dye filament becomes wavy throughout indicating transition flow. On further increasing the velocity the filament breaks up and diffuses completely in the water in the glass tube indicating the turbulent flow.
