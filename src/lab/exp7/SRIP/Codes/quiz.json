      "answer": "unsteady and uniform",
      "description": "The velocity in which the water is discharged with a velocity With time as the water gets discharged,v decreases as H decreases. Hence, it will be an unsteady flow.According to the continuity equation, ρAV =constant, where ρ= density, A= cross-sectional area of flow, V = velocity of flow. Since water is treated as an incompressible liquid (ρ =constant) and the pipe has a uniform diameter (A =constant) at a given instant, V will remain constant throughout the whole cross-section of the pipe. Hence, it will be a uniform flow."
